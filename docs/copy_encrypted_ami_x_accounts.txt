Script:
    copy_encrypted_ami_x_accounts.sh

Description:
    This script is for copying AMI image from one AWS account to another AWS account.
During the copy, the script will also encrypt the copied snapshot.
    By running this script, we assume that the user has already having a PC with
system which is capable to run AWS command line tool. And AWS command line tool is
properly installed in the system.

Instructions:
    *.  For setup accounts and keys, you may need help from your AWS administrator.
    1.  $ cp copy_encrypted_ami_x_accounts.conf.dist \
            copy_encrypted_ami_x_accounts.conf
    2.  Find AWS account IDs of both source account and target account.
        And update following variables in config file
            AWS_ACCT_ID_SRC : the ID for source account
            AWS_ACCT_ID_DST : the ID for target account
    3.  Update following variables in config file to indicate proper region.
            REGION_FROM :   the region where your source AMI image in, in the source
                            account
            REGION_TO   :   the region your source AMI image will be copied to, in the
                            target account
    4.  In both source and target AWS account, create an IAM account. Generate Access
        Key and Secret Access Key for both accounts.
    5.  Setup 2 different AWS command line profiles using command:
        $ aws configure --profile <profile_name>
        And update following variables in config file
            AWSCLI_PROF_SRC : the profile represents the IAM user in source account
            AWSCLI_PROF_DST : the profile represents the IAM user in target account
    6.  Permission for IAM user in source account.
        Attach policy "AmazonEC2FullAccess".
    7.  Permission for IAM user in target account.
        Attach policy "AmazonEC2FullAccess".
        And attach following policy document as inline policy.
        {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Sid": "Stmt1499311128000",
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": [
                        "kms:CreateGrant",
                        "kms:Decrypt",
                        "kms:DescribeKey",
                        "kms:Encrypt",
                        "kms:GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext"
                    ],
                    "Resource": [
                        "*"
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    8.  In the source account, pick a non-default KMS key for the copy. Allow the IAM
        user you just created in the source account to use the key. Update
        "KMS_ID_SRC" in the config file with the key ID. If there's no custom master
        key, just create one.
        Also, add external account access to the target account on the web console.
    9.  In the target account, pick a non-default KMS key for the copy. Allow the IAM
        user you just created in the target account to use the key. Update
        "KMS_ID_DST" in the config file with the key ID. If there's no custom master
        key, just create one.
    10. Run the script:
        $ ./copy_encrypted_ami_x_accounts.sh <source_ami_id>
        <source_ami_id> :   ID of the AMI image you want to copy from source account
                            to target account
